## The Task

- The task for the week: "This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes."

| All prompts are answered                                             | A password is generated that matches the selected criteria                         |

## Developer Notes

  This project a big dive into funtions, how to call them, how to organize variables in JS, hoisting, equal to (and all variations), window alerts or confirms, else if statements, and for loops.  Funtions seem pretty straight forward now that I understand how to call them.
